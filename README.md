# RSVP-Movie-SQL-Project
Derived meaningful insights that can aid RSVP Movies in planning their next move strategically.
The analytics process was divided into four segments, each focused on different aspects of the data. I provided solutions to the questions in each segment, addressing specific business objectives. By applying SQL queries, I was able to uncover valuable information that can guide RSVP Movies in their new project.

Ultimately, my project using SQL helped RSVP Movies gain insights into the data and make informed decisions to successfully launch their global audience movie in 2022.
